I'm Sebastien, co-founder of [CASE](https://case.app) and [Buddyweb](https://buddyweb.fr). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CASE, an Open Source tool that should help developers to build CRUD applications easy and fast ! My team and I are passionate about it. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CPO job. I spent a lot of years managing buddyweb customer projects. Now, I have to manage a product we have created ourselves. it's interesting and challenging !
- ðŸ‘¯ I can collaborate on Open Source projects, especailly if it's in relation with style integration and design.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about UI & UX Design, front-end integration. I will do my best to help.
