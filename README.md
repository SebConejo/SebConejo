### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sebastien, co-founder of [manifest](https://manifest.build) and [Buddyweb](https://buddyweb.fr). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on manifest, a simple backend allowing developers to build and deliver backend as easy as it can be. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CPO job. I spent a lot of years managing buddyweb customer projects. Now, I have to manage a product we have created ourselves. it's interesting and challenging !
- ðŸ‘¯ I can collaborate on Open Source projects, especailly if it's in relation with style integration and design.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about UI & UX Design, front-end integration. I will do my best to help.

- âš¡ Fun facts: 
    - Outside work, I'm passionate about drawing. You can find some artworks on my instagram or on my Procreate profile for example. 
    - You can challenge me on some gaming platforms I love to play : chess.com and sorare.com. My Alias is `Stosssik`
